# Fibonacci Numbers
A simple fibonacci implementation, done both recursively and non-recursively.

## How to Run

The program is ran by the following command line:

*python3 src/fibonacci.py <len>*

The len argument decides the length of the fibonacci sequence. If set to 10, the 10 first fibonacci numbers are calculated and so on.

### Results

The fibonacci sequence will be written to *results/fibonacci.txt*.
